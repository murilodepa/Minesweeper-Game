### Guia de Instalação
* To run the program in the Kotlin language, in which the algorithm was performed, you need an integrated development environment (IDE) Java, in the case of the project the "IntelliJ IDEA" was used, but another platform can be used. To install the "IntelliJ IDEA", it is necessary to install the JDK, below you can see a tutorial to install the JDK and the "IntelliJ IDEA" in relation to the compatibility of your operating system:

* <a> [Tutorial to install the JDK](https://www.devmedia.com.br/instalacao-e-configuracao-do-pacote-java-jdk/23749)  
* <a> [Tutorial to install the "IntelliJ IDEA"](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=54920165)  
  
### Prerequisites

#### Operational system
* The Windows 10 was used, but it can be performed on another operating system, you need to install the compiler compatible with the operating system.

 #### Kotlin Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* The "IntelliJ IDEA" was used. The "IntelliJ IDEA" is an integrated development environment written in Java for developing computer software..  
* <a> [Get information about "IntelliJ IDEA"](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/opensource/idea/)  
  
* **NOTE:** To develop this project, you only need basic knowledge about programming logic, application creation in Kotlin language.
  
### Development
* Git clone https://github.com/murilodepa/Minesweeper-Game.git  
* If you perform "Download ZIP", you need a file decompressor.  
* Once you have installed IntelliJ IDEA or another similar program, run it and select "file" and then "open project".
